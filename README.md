# BayesNetExplorer
The BayesNetExplorer (BNE) package simplifies the creation, analysis, and interpretation of Bayesian networks. A user selects a target variable and calculates the network propagated probability of a target outcome given one or more conditional variables. Absolute and relative risk ratios are obtained from any combination of conditional variables and conditional variable states. Conditional variables with the greatest impact on the target are quickly identified, and the magnitude of their effect on the target can directly quantified. Additional functions provide estimates of outcome probabilities by probabilistic tree traversal. The signficance of an outcome can be evaluated by bootstrap resampling.
