# BayesNetExplorer
The BayesNetExplorer (BNE) package simplifies the creation, analysis, and interpretation of Bayesian networks. A user selects a target variable and calculates the network propagated probability of a target outcome given one or more conditional variables. Multiple target queries are possible. Absolute and relative risk ratios can be obtained from various combinations of conditional variables and conditional variable states. Conditional variables with the greatest impact on the target are quickly identified, and the magnitude of their effect on the target can be directly quantified. Additional functions provide estimates of outcome probabilities by probabilistic tree traversal. The significance of an outcome can be evaluated by bootstrap resampling.

This package is under active development. Suggestions, errors, and bug reports to [scott.watkins@utah.edu] are greatly appreciated.
